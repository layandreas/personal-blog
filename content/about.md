[My Resume on GitHub](https://github.com/layandreas/typst-resume/blob/main/cv_andreas_lay_en.pdf) • [Contact](mailto:andreas.lay@gmail.com)

This blog is mainly intended as a reference for myself to keep short notes on lessons learned regarding smaller or bigger technical challenges or new technologies — however there is no point in keeping this knowledge private and if any of these posts helps someone else, the better! I try to keep posts relatively small, concise and focused.

You're welcome to check out:
